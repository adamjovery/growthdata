# growthdata
Panel dataset across 145 developing countries over the period between 1970-2023.
This includes the code required to recreate the results of my regression analyses performed in my dissertation:

An investigation into correlates of growth in developing countries: “Which government policies and environmental factors have had the greatest effect on the differing levels of economic growth that have occurred in developing countries since the 1970s?”

This also includes the code used to create the dataset once the data has been downloaded from various sources (World Bank, PWT10.01, etc)
